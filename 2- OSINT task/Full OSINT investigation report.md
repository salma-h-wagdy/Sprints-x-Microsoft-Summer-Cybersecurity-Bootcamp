# üïµÔ∏è OSINT Investigation Report: DarkWebX

## üîπ Introduction

This report details an Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigation conducted on a cybercriminal operating under the alias **DarkWebX**. The aim was to collect publicly available intelligence on their digital footprint, including social media activity, email presence, IP traces, and any data breaches.

The project was part of the **Sprints x Microsoft Summer Cybersecurity Bootcamp** and builds real-world cyber threat hunting and intelligence-gathering skills using ethical, legal methods.

## üîπ Steps Followed:

A structured OSINT approach was followed using:

- `Sherlock`: Identified social media profiles by username.
- `theHarvester`: Discovered email addresses tied to domains.
- `HaveIBeenPwned`: Checked for breached credentials.
- `Hudson Rock`: Analyzed stealer logs and leaked data.
- `IntelligenceX`: Searched for mentions in data breaches, IPs, and leak dumps.
- `Google Dorking`: Tried to Locate indexed dark web/forum content.

Each finding was verified where possible for activity, relevance, and credibility.

## üîπ Findings

### 1. Social Media Accounts (SOCMINT)

Sherlock identified **29** platform hits using the alias `DarkWebX`.

#### ‚úÖ Verified Accounts
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/DarkWebX) ‚Äî **Active**
- [Hudson Rock OSINT API](https://cavalier.hudsonrock.com/api/json/v2/osint-tools/search-by-username?username=DarkWebX) ‚Äî **Leaked credentials confirmed**

#### the rest were Dormant or invalid/Unreachable Accounts 

üìé *Screenshots and Sherlock logs are included in `screenshots/` and `sherlock_output.txt`*

### 2. Email Addresses

Using `theHarvester` across multiple domains,  the only identified result was:

- `yourusername@protonmail.com`

then i checked it via **HaveIBeenPwned**, but it wasn't involved in any data breaches

### 3. Breached Credentials & Leak Logs

Using **Hudson Rock's OSINT API**, it was confirmed that the alias `DarkWebX` is tied to **2 stealer-infected systems**:

| Date Compromised | Stealer Family | OS             | Computer Name | IP Address    | Malware Path                   |

#### Top leaked credentials (obfuscated for ethics):

- **Emails**: `d*****@gmail.com`, `k******@hotmail.com`
- **Passwords**: `m*********0`, `N*******d`
