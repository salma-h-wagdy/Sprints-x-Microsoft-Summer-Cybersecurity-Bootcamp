Breached Data Spotted:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


During SOCMINT, I discovered the following resource :  https://cavalier.hudsonrock.com/api/json/v2/osint-tools/search-by-username?username=DarkWebX

which led me to this data from Hudson Rock’s OSINT API tools, :

Leaked Credentials (via Info-Stealer Infection)

the alias DarkWebX is tied to two compromised machines infected by known info-stealers:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date Compromised	Stealer     Family	    OS	    Comp Name	IP Address (Partial)	Malware Path
2024-02-08	        Lumma	    Win 10      x64	    Kelvin	    138.94.*.**	            BitLockerToGo.exe
2024-01-25	        RedLine	    Win 10 Home x64	    HP	        201.218.*.**	        Not Found

    Top leaked credentials (obfuscated) included:

        Emails: d*****@gmail.com, k******@hotmail.com, etc.

        Passwords: m*********0, N*******d, etc.

This confirms exposure of DarkWebX’s credentials, likely enabling unauthorized access to social media, email, and online services.
